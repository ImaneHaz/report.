# CI/CD

## High-level description

**CI/CD Overview**

The Graph Website utilizes a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the development lifecycle, enhancing code quality and deployment efficiency. This automated process is integrated into the GitHub repository and leverages GitHub Actions to streamline workflows.

**Key Components of the CI/CD Pipeline**

- Continuous Integration (CI):

The CI process is triggered by events such as code pushes and pull requests to the main branch. Each code change is automatically tested to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs.

- Automated Testing:
The pipeline includes automated linting and testing stages.
ESLint is utilized to enforce coding standards and ensure code quality, while Jest is employed to run unit tests, verifying the application's functionality.

- Build Process:
Although the Graph Website currently does not require a dedicated build step, the CI/CD pipeline is designed to accommodate future enhancements that may necessitate this process.

- Continuous Deployment (CD):
Upon successful completion of testing and linting, the latest version of the Graph Website is automatically published to the npm registry. This allows users to access the most stable and updated version of the application without manual intervention, facilitating an efficient delivery process.

- Environment Management:
The CI/CD pipeline utilizes environment variables, such as the npm authentication token, to securely handle sensitive information during the deployment process.

**Benefits of the CI/CD Approach**

- Increased Efficiency: Automation reduces manual steps, enabling faster deployment cycles and quicker access to new features for users.

- Improved Code Quality: Regular testing and linting ensure that code quality is maintained, resulting in a more reliable application.

- Rapid Feedback: Developers receive immediate feedback on code changes, allowing for quicker identification and resolution of issues.

- Scalability: The CI/CD pipeline is designed to scale with the project, accommodating future features and enhancements with minimal changes to the existing workflow.
