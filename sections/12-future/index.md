# Known issues and future work

In future iterations of the GraphProject, several enhancements could significantly improve user experience and engagement. One key recommendation is to implement user authentication, allowing users to create accounts for a more personalized experience. This feature would enable users to save their graphs, making it easier for them to revisit their work without having to re-enter equations.

Additionally, introducing download options for graphs as images or data files would provide users with the ability to easily share their work outside the platform. This could be further enhanced by incorporating share functionality that allows users to post their graphs on social media or generate shareable links.
